This is my personal portfolio
There has been quite a few versions of this as I am learning new things and better ways to code certain aspects of my website.

There are quite a few things I learned as I was putting this and the projects together.

Things I learned:
1. Navbar: The navbar always gave me a tricky issue. If I went sticky I would have to change the viewport height of the showcase img to less than 100. So, I decided to put navbar position at fixed and keep the viewport height at 100.
